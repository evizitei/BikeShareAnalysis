    "[Bay Area Bike Share](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/) is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will put yourself in the shoes of a data analyst performing an exploratory analysis on the data. You will take a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. But before you even start looking at data, think about some questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Bay Area Bike Share: what kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? Or you might think about if you were a user of the bike share service. What factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",

    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to explore the data for yourself. Year 1 and Year 2 data from the Bay Area Bike Share's [Open Data](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data) page have already been provided with the project materials; you don't need to download anything extra. The data comes in three parts: the first half of Year 1 (files starting `201402`), the second half of Year 1 (files starting `201408`), and all of Year 2 (files starting `201508`). There are three main datafiles associated with each part: trip data showing information about each trip taken in the system (`*_trip_data.csv`), information about the stations in the system (`*_station_data.csv`), and daily weather data for each city in the system (`*_weather_data.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with a lot of data, it can be useful to start by working with only a sample of the data. This way, it will be much easier to check that our data wrangling steps are working since our code will take less time to complete. Once we are satisfied with the way things are working, we can then set things up to work on the dataset as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bulk of the data is contained in the trip information, we should target looking at a subset of the trip data to help us get our bearings. You'll start by looking at only the first month of the bike trip data, from 2013-08-29 to 2013-09-30. The code below will take the data from the first half of the first year, then write the first month's worth of data to an output file. This code exploits the fact that the data is sorted by date (though it should be noted that the first two days are sorted by trip time, rather than being completely chronological).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, load all of the packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis by running the first code cell below. Then, run the second code cell to read a subset of the first trip data file, and write a new file containing just the subset we are initially interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift** + **Enter** or **Shift** + **Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. `In [*]:`. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. `In [1]`. If there is output, it will show up as `Out [1]:`, with an appropriate number to match the \"In\" number."

Filters should be given as a list of conditions, each element should be a string in the following format: `'<field> <op> <value>'` using one of the following operations: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=. Data points must satisfy all conditions to be counted or visualized. For example, `[\"duration < 15\", \"start_city == 'San Francisco'\"]` retains only trips that originated in San Francisco and are less than 15 minutes long.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about our data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the code given. Instead of just looking at number of trips on the outcome axis, you could see what features affect things like trip duration. We also haven't looked at how the weather data ties into bike usage.\n",

We can also export the Notebook output in a form that can be opened even for those without Python installed. From the **File** menu in the upper left, go to the **Download as** submenu.
